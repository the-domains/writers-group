"What are we?" He asked.

"Knock Knock"

"Oh come now, enough of that."

"Knock Knock Knock."

"You never give me a straightened out answer."

"Straighten the calm water with your hand."

"You see! You did it again. What are we?"

"Knock on the sky and listen."

"You're hopeless..."

"Planting flowers to which the butterflies come."

A wind rustled through his fingers..."I thought I left my fingers by the stream." He said, feeling them again for the first time.

"We are eternal."

"Oh, yes! Now we are getting somewhere. What do you mean by that?"

"Move the mountain with your mind and see."

A silence grew between them, a wind rustled. Birds chirped and the sound of water flowing down stream was everlasting.

"How long is this going to take?"

"Long and short both."

"You know that doesn't make any sense. If we are going to be here a long while, we mind as well be honest with each other. Just tell me. What are we?"

"What makes you think I know something that you don't?"

He was surprised by the length of the answer. He never answered like that. Usually it was with riddles or strange noises, or sometimes even silence. He paused, thinking carefully about his next words. He wanted to keep the conversation going, but knew the very second he said the wrong thing, it would go back to riddles and noises. Or even silence, which was worst of all.

He thought, and thought, until the sun set somewhere behind, and darkness slowly rounded on them both, shrinking their worlds until everything disappeared into blackness. The sound of running water creeped on and on, accompanied by a cacophony of chittering birds and insects.

The words came to him as the sun began rise the next day, lifting itself over the mountains, illuminating the earth around them, growing, until the whole forest was painted in a pale grey light. He weighed each word carefully before he spoke it.

"Well," He started gingerly, "because, you're a bit higher up than I am. You can see a bit more than I can from up there." He answered.

"I see nothing but forest and stream. The valley and the mountains beyond."

He looked out at the mountains, and the stream that flowed between the two of them. "But that's all that I see too." He complained.

"What makes you think it's the same?"

He thought carefully. It felt like he was finally getting somewhere, and the last thing he wanted was for it to go back to the way it was before. That was torture.

The sun instinctually set behind the mountains, leaving in its place a moonless night. Darkness swallowed them both and they were accompanied by nothing but the sound of running water, and an animal scurrying every now and then was like an itch being scratched. At last, he thought he found the words to say.

"Because we look the same." He spoke out into the darkness. "Why shouldn't we see the same too?"

"But you can't see me. How do you even know what I look like?"

"That's only because it's dark! Wait until the light comes up and I will show you."

He waited and watched. Until the sun came up and covered the forest in pearl grey light. He watched the outline of his companion come into focus, a little higher up on the other side of the stream, but still he waited. He waited until the sun rose to its highest, when the colours of the forest flourished their most vibrant shades of greens and browns and golds, and the water was at its clearest, sparkling as it flowed down between grey boulders.

"Can you see now? Surely you can. See how similar we look?" They both had the same sandy brown hair and blue eyes. The same dark oaken coloured skin and the same lanky limbs. Both of their arms were outstretched, and their long extended fingers twitched in the slightest breeze.

"So?"

"So, we are the same! And you must know who we are. You must!"

"I don't want to tell you. I don't think it's a good idea."

"What! Why not?"

"Because. I think you might take it badly."

"No, I won't. I promise."

It was all he wanted. All he ever wanted from the very beginning. To know what he was. To know why he was here. To know what was coming at the end of it all. He figured there must be something else coming.

"Okay. Well, if I tell you, do you promise never to ask me ever again?"

"I promise, I promise! Just tell me who I am and I won't ever need to ask." He pleaded.

"Fine then, I'll tell you, and then you never ask me again. And no other questions either. If I tell, you are never allowed to ask me a question ever again. And if you do, I won't answer... So, are you sure you really want to know?"

"Yes, of course I do. Why wouldn't I?"

"Well, it's just that I think you like asking the questions. You have been asking them for a long time now."

"And you have never answered before."

"No, never."

"Why?"

"I thought we were playing a game. But, I think I've realised now, you really just don't know..."

"It's true! I don't know! All this time I was asking, and you would never tell me. It's been torture. But I am ready to know, I promise I am."

"Okay, I'll tell you, and then no more questions. Ever. And things will go back to the way they were before."

"Deal. Now just tell me."

The sun set and darkness swallowed them up. Animals scurried in the forest, birds chirped, insects nagged incessantly. The river flowed humbly downstream between them. The sun rose and the forest came to life with colour and beauty, and he watched it all unfold as it did every day. He watched on as the sun rolled over the forest to set somewhere behind, until the sky turned orange. The darkness crept up slowly and one-thousand twinkling lights replaced the power of the sun, sparkling over them in majestic radiance. And as the sun began to rise again on the third day, a rain started in the valley below, and a rainbow formed over it. Only then did his companion uphold his promise.

"We are the mountains, the streams, the clouds. All of it. Both you and I. We are everything. And without us there would be nothing."

"We are the mountains? How can we be the mountains... And the streams? I look nothing like a stream... What am I?

"Planting flowers to which the butterflies come."

"What are we? Truly. Come now, you promised."

"Knock Knock."

"What am I? I'm not a mountain. I'm not! I can't be."

"Knock on the sky and listen."

"Stop it! You tell me. You promised you would. You promised you would tell me. You promised to make it all stop. You promised to fix me!"

"Move the mountains with your mind."

"Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!" He screamed. With a mighty heave he uprooted his feet from the rocky stream. He tore his arms from their outstretched position, dislocating them to his side. He turned his back on the mountains and valleys beyond, and started to make his way up the stream.

"You are walking the wrong way." His companion observed.

With an effort he stopped. Turned around, staring into the almond brown eyes of his companion that matched his own. A feeling of hatred and resentment flared up inside of him. In a flash of rage, and with a strength and speed he never possessed before, he picked up a jagged stone by the stream and slammed it into his companions head. Red blood sprayed from his temple. Splattering the grey rocks and trees in scarlet stars. His companion stood fast, scarcely moving, with his arms outstretched and his fingers twitching. Blood ran down his neck and chest, down his belly and knees into the stream, mixing with the clear water.

"Yes. You are moving the mountains with your mind." His companion whispered, and he collapsed into the stream.
