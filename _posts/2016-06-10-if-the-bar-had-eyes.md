"But I don't get it, how could you say he deserves it?" He asked, taking a nip of his own drink; a dry whisky on the rocks.

"Well, you take a long look at him and tell me whose else fault it is." At the mahogany bar a man sat in a disheveled, pale blue suit: tall, overweight, blonde hair thinning at the top. His white shirt underneath was untucked at the back like a ducks tail, protruding out from his suit jacket. "He's only half way to homelessness at the moment, but he'll end up there--- mark my words."

"You come in here often, then?"

"Yeah, most nights. I've watched you plenty of times, but there isn't much to see. You just come in, order the same brand of whisky and shell up. Well, beg my pardon--- it should be said--- you don't shell up the way most drinkers do. Your eyes don't look backward, they just sort of... Forgive me for prying but if I had to guess I'd say your a man that's seen too much, rather than not too little."

He gave a snort of laughter. "That's not far off the mark. I retired last month, if you want to call it that."

"That makes sense. You still dress like one of them--- trench coat and all. I'd have guessed, but I always prefer to hear it for myself."

The conversation died on their lips. The man at the bar polished off his glass and ordered another one. The bartender turned to get him one. "Maybe something happened to him. Maybe business went bad." He said, taking another a nip of his whisky. "Or a business partner swindled him. I've seen that story played out plenty of times."

"Whatever happened he deserved it. Same way he deserves to be a drunk."

"I'd prefer to believe he got dealt a bad hand... How does anyone deserve to be a drunk?"

"Because, it's what he really wants, deep down."

"Yeah? Well why don't you go over and ask him if it's what he really wants..." He said, tilting his whisky glass in his hand, watching the amber coloured liquid collect in the corner.

"Oh, he would make some excuse up, no doubt. He puts on a real show when he gets going--- he could blame a butterfly for his balding."

"Maybe he would; but he still doesn't deserve it. No one does."

The bartender poured another drink for the drunk and slid it across the counter to him. He caught it gracefully in his hand without barely moving it left or right. It was like watching a worn out dance; both partners knowing the steps a little too well. "He ordered that drink because he wanted it, and because he wanted it--- he got it. Because he got it--- he deserves it. And if he passes out drunk on the way home and some punk steals his wallet he will deserve that just as much."

Just then the door of the bar burst open, silencing them, as a girl in a tight fitting yellow dress strolled in. Wide hips, long legs and a curtain of brown curls fell to her shoulders. From their table in the corner, shrouded in shadow from a beam that crossed the ceiling light, they watched her take a seat in a empty booth. She pulled out her phone and started texting.

"Pretty thing." He said, raising the whisky glass once more to his lips.

"Oh, boy. You are in for a _real _treat tonight." A smile crept across his face, crooked and knowing.

"Oh yeah? And why's that."

"Snake eyes is in tonight. Might be we're both going to get more than we bargained for."

"Who's snake eyes?"

"That guy over there in the corner with the baseball cap drinking gin. That's his third tonight. She could be in some real hot water if he goes for a fourth. It's hit or miss for the moment--- on a knifes edge so to speak..."

"What are you talking about?"

"No point beating around the bush. Snake eyes is a rapist."

"Bullshit."

"I don't know what he says to them--- or even what he does to them--- but they never seem to squawk. He'll disappear for a month or two. Idk, maybe he goes someplace else. Maybe he just waits until the heat dies down. Either way he's been back in the game a couple of weeks now."

"Bullshit." He took another quick sip, a little nervously, as he considered the man sitting at a table near the entrance. His instincts immediately kicked in. His cap was drawn low over his eyes. He wore a nondescript grey flannel and blue jeans. He had a good view of the bar and wouldn't be seen immediately by anyone who came through the entrance. It all made sense. "What are the chances he'll go through with it?" He asked.

"Well, that depends entirely on what the girls wants."

He put his glass down on the table and turned slowly to look the man in the eyes. They were dark brown, like the darkened timber tables around them. They were like the bar itself, in fact. If the bar had eyes. "You can't mean th---"

"You know what I mean." He said, the crooked smile evaporating from his face. "Let's see what little miss daisy _really _wants, deep down."

The conversation died on their lips.

They watched her text on her phone for a while, then she put it down and started toying absently with a napkin. Eventually the waiter came around and she ordered herself a drink. Snake eyes ordered his fourth. She picked up her phone again, but had seemed to run out of patience for it's company, scrolling back and forth idly. She glanced back at the door three times during all of this.

A little while later she finished her drink and made for the door. Her long legs working in graceful strides, causing her hips to bounce about. As she left Snake Eyes quickly raised his glass, making the pretence of a sip, covering his face from her view. His eyes followed her to the door and his head turned to watch her leave. As she did he lowered the glass a little and then froze, as if caught in some internal struggle. He sat there still as a stone statue for a moment, and then a moment more. Finally with a flourish he threw his head back and downed the last of his gin. He stood up made for the door after her.

"Well I'll be damned." He said, rising to his feet, bumping the table and knocking over his whisky glass. The man grabbed him by the sleeve of his trench coat.

"Hold on one second. Do you really want to get in the way this? This is fate, friend. This is what she really wants. What they both want."

He paused, considering the mans grip on his sleeve. "Listen Mr... I don't give a fuck what you say; she doesn't deserve it I'm not going to sit around and let it that happen."

"Well alright then, you go and stop him. But before you do I want you to know the way of it. The true way of it... A girl like that--- dressed up in her gaudy Sunday ensemble--- parks her car in the only space left across the street. Don't believe me? Well, I guess you'll find out soon enough... She goes waltzing down that dark alley to get here, but she ignores that nagging fear in her guts. "_Only girls are afraid of the dark_." She tells herself. Now she comes bursting into a bar full of--- well, to be completely honest--- less than reputable middle aged men; mostly single, divorced, or just plain randy. She waits, but her friend stands her up--- which is no big shocker--- as this particular friend was known to be un-unreliable on occasion. "_That bimbo Brittany stood me up again! Oh well._" She tells herself, ignoring that nagging fear that hasn't quite gone away since she came in through that door. Well, she downs her one drink, gets eyeballed the whole time by old snake eyes, and she doesn't spook. A horse would have spooked. A _dog_ would have spooked. She doesn't. Not even a little. She just gets right on up and fish walks out of here snapping her little ass left to right--- back down that fucked-up-dark alley she had a bad feeling in the first time... Now, looking at the whole of it, you tell me there wasn't something else going on here tonight."

He paused, for a moment, staring at the mans curious eyes, considering his words. He paused a moment longer. Then another. "I can say I've met some men in my time," he said slowly, "my profession demanded it of me. I've met all sorts of characters: psychopaths, rapists, serial killers, child molesters, and worse. Some of those men I hope to forget with time... I hope I forget you most of all."

He pulled his sleeve away and darted out of the door after them.
