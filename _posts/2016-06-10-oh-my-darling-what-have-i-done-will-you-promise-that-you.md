  Oh, my darling… What have I done…  Will you promise that you love me, still?
  No matter the things I’ve seen and done. I am afraid that I am all too ready
  to come home, my love… I want to come back now. I’ve seen enough. I want to
  come back to the station. Oh, GOD do I want that more than anything in this
  world! I want my eyes to wander over the land. I want my eyes to scan over the
  plains for miles in every direction, over the vast freedom of it all. I want
  my eyes to look over your body too, once more, my dearest. Damn, just to look
  at you would be enough. Just one look would keep me going. Here, we have
  nothing but the view of these god-forsaken cliffs and trenches (at the present
  moment, if I put my head up for a peek of anything, I’d likely be given a pill
  in my forehead)… Yes, a pill. A sweet Turkish kiss…

Oh, my darling... What have I done...  
Will you promise that you love me, still? No matter the things I've seen and done. I am afraid that I am all too ready to come home, my love... I want to come back now. I've seen enough. I want to come back to the station. Oh, GOD do I want that more than anything in this world! I want my eyes to wander over the land. I want my eyes to scan over the plains for miles in every direction, over the vast freedom of it all. I want my eyes to look over your body too, once more, my dearest. Damn, just to look at you would be enough. Just one look would keep me going. Here, we have nothing but the view of these god-forsaken cliffs and trenches (at the present moment, if I put my head up for a peek of anything, I'd likely be given a pill in my forehead)... Yes, a pill. A sweet Turkish kiss...

I want to herd my cattle again, that was what I was born to do, not this. I want a fucking horse beneath my legs again!... You must excuse me, dear, I am not myself. Nor have I been for some time, I suppose. The rats are eating Jamie's eyes now. We couldn't get to him out in no man's land... Oh, what am I saying? You don't need to hear about all that. All you need to know is I am alive and doing well, my darling, and thinking of your sweet kiss. Yes, a sweet kiss...

I am almost there with you now, if I think hardly on it. With this hot sun beating down on my skin, if I just close my eyes and feel the heat--- the dirt in my fingernails and the taste of dust in my mouth--- the crack of a rifle could almost be the sound of a whip in my hand, and the moaning of these wounded men could be those beautiful dumb beasts; my cattle.

I think I should tell you that, before he went over, I had some words with Jamie.

"Is that you, Jamie?" Walking the line I spotted him busy carving his name into the trench wall with his bayonet."Whats this you're up too?" I asked, (most others were busy polishing and cleaning rifle for the assault, fixing bayonets to the end, but here he was carving with his). "I dare say, chap, that there bayonet would be a dash more useful attached at the end of rifle."

"G'day Lieutenant," he responded all chipper, "oh this? It ain't nothing. Just wanted to leave a little reminder here, is all."

"A reminder of what?" I questioned.

"Why, a reminder of me, Lieutenant."

This did strike a cord with me. Poor bugger was secretly terrified, although, his face refused to show it. He was a deep thinker, you see, and this was his first of any real fighting."You will be just fine Jamie, we will take Johnny Turk completely by surprise, and have the trench in no time." I reassured him. But this didn't seem to ease his nerves the slightest. He ignored me, and for the longest time was set to scratching the date of his birth into the wall.1898! He was only seventeen god save him. He scratched a small dash and then the days date in as well. I sat down and settled myself beside him. I took out a pack of coffin nails and offered him one, (he tried to refuse, but I held it firm until he took it). I lit mine and took a deep pull, I lit his next and he did the same --- damn near coughed his lungs out! For fuck sake it was his first... Too young, far too young darling. He asked me a question that might haunt me until my last.

"Whats it like to die, Lieutenant? You've seen em die, haven't ya?" He asked, his cigarette pitched awkwardly at his side. I took a long draw and observed his face, young and clean shaven for the occasion--- a rare thing on the front, (water being desperately rationed), blonde with curly hair and baby blue eyes. I exhaled and saw that his lip was quivering.

"I am going to die, Lieutenant. I don't want to go over the top. I am going to die and I know it. Don't you give me that bullshit encouragement neither! I know my times up, I can feel it... Please don't make me do it Lieutenant..." He pleaded. "Please, I'm too young, don't make me go over."

I didn't say anything. I couldn't. What do you tell a boy? If he didn't go over he'd be shot for treason, he didn't have a choice.

"You signed up for this kid, what did you think it would be like?" I said. I watched him take a small pull, holding it down this time and breathing out a wispy puff of smoke. "Not like this" He said without a voice, no emotion in him. "I don't much care to die, gonna happen anyways I suppose. I just want to know a little what it will be like. I'm scared not knowing is all."

I didn't have any words for him. But he reminded me of a friend I had a while back, when we were stationed in Egypt. A true thinker he was, called himself a philosopher, but was godless and a drinker too. Well, one night he got drunk, and started talking about death and all the rest. But it seemed to make real sense and gave me some real comfort as a younger lad. So I gave him his words instead.

"Have you ever had a good sleep, Jamie? No, not the ones here, where you wake up every thirty minutes from shelling, one of those deep, dreamless peaceful sleeps. Where you wake up and have to remember who you are." We both stopped and took another draw, getting all lost in old memories which took us a miles away from the turkish cliffs.

He said, "Yeah, I know that kind, had one of em back home before I shipped out. I'll tell it true, Lieutenant, It was right after I gave my sheila her first root! Ha!" He laughed so hard, I tell you darling, that it made me laugh! But made me sad and happy all at once, because he had me truly convinced that he wasn't going to make it, and it was like we were having his bloody funeral, right there and then! And his fucking gravestone over his head with the dates and all! Like I was talking to the ghost of him. He was a handsome chap, I must say. And looked more so when he laughed, and when he smiled it looked as if he harnessed all the happiness of the world. Eventually we both simmered down, and he apologised. "Sorry Lieutenant. You were saying, about that deep sleepin'?" We took another drag each, longer and fuller still. And it became all serious again, darling. And we stared into each others eyes, (his were the bluest I've ever seen).

"Imagine that you go into one of those deep, dreamless sleeps, Jamie. And now imagine that you failed to wake up." He thought about it. "That is how I imagine death to be. And if you're a god fearing man, well then, you'll be going to heaven, won't you? And that wouldn't be so bad now, would it?" I smiled at him and he chuckled, but tears rolled down his cheeks. He leaned back against the trench wall and closed his eyes. And kept them closed while he took another drag; his longest yet. And above his head his name and those dates. And I saw, in that moment, darling, that the dash between the two numbers... that dash held all his life. And one day, I would have one of similar length on my tomb stone, and it would hold all of my living as well. I couldn't bear it anymore, so I patted him gently on the shoulder, and he didn't rouse one bit, but took another breath of smoke into his lungs and smiled, almost imperceptibly. And with that I continued down the line to check on the other men, but the whole time I could think only of Jamie... Jamie.

I failed to mention that I was promoted to second Lieutenant and platoon leader, (it has been some time since I last wrote), and with that I was given a stout whistle with a plaited leather lanyard. After I did the rounds and readied the men, I took my pocket watch in hand, watched it ticking intently. It was two minutes to the schedule. And for that entire two minutes I thought of Jamie. I realised that I didn't want him to go over. I wanted to save him. If I blew the whistle he was dead. I already knew that men would die, but it was different now. I could still save him, I thought. If he was sick and deemed not fit for duty, I could give him leave. But he was too far down the line, you see. I'd never make it to him in time. And the watch kept ticking, ticking, ticking.

It was deathly silent, my love. A silence I never knew before. A silence so thick that I was sure it could have stopped the bullets in the air. When there was ten seconds left I put the brass and copper whistle to my mouth, and realised that my hand was shaking violently. And then I blew. A terrible high screech that cut the silence open to the shouting cheers of men. It wasn't long until I heard the typewriters start up. Rattling horribly like caged death being released. I blew it again after that, and again. Until the thirty-three men of my platoon were up and over the top, climbing over the dead and dying. I herded them, darling, like they were cattle. Herded them up and over and into the fields of death.

Oh, If these cliffs could tell stories, they would be sad ones, my dearest. They would be the whispers of final prayers and unsaid fair-wells. And if they could talk... oh, they would be the bane of the widows I tell you! For how could the heartbroken live? Knowing that somewhere out in the world, there's a blood-stained foreign soil, holding greedily onto desperate words spoken in one final moment of love. Surely, they couldn't live knowing... Surely, you would come, wouldn't you darling? Will you come? Come here and kiss the dirt to hear my voice one last time?
