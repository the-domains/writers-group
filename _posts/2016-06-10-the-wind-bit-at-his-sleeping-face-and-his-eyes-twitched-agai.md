The wind bit at his sleeping face and his eyes twitched against the cold. In the distance on a busy street a bus slammed on its brakes with a "screeeeeeeeeech," bringing it to a terrible halt, and an old car backfired with a "BOOOM," as it accelerated up a hill.

He awoke, eyes darting open to observe the red glow left by the sun setting over the water in the distance. A light that seemed to paint everything dead: the parked cars, the street signs and street lights, the buildings and windows and the black fenced motel across the road... And the homeless, strewn all along the sidewalk like corpses, covered from head to toe under grey musky blankets.   
Carlos observed the scene from the safety of his home, sheltered under the door frame of an old red-bricked factory. He looked out at the carnage of the street in dismay.   
"You let them die. You did this." A voice whispered in his ear... He ignored it.   
He was wearing a large brown trench coat with pockets stitched on the inside with dark green thread. He reached into them one by one, emptying them, starting with his innermost pockets and working outward. He lay them all out on the street before him: a black and white photograph, a deck of cards, a silver spoon, a Colt M19 Pistol, a slender glass pipe, a lighter, and a little bag of small white rocks.  
He took a pen and paper from his pants pocket and checked off each item, noting the condition and inspecting for defects.  
He picked up the pistol and polished it methodically. He loaded and un-loaded the clip before putting it back in it's rightful place deep within the countless folds. He counted all 52 of the playing cards and cleaned the spoon until it shone bright like knights armour.   
With a shaky hand he cleaned his slender pipe with affection, cradling it like a wounded dove. Carefully, he picked up the small bag of white rocks and fed them into the mouth with a forbearance; with a guilty sin and pleasure. He lit the fire in one hand and brought it to his mouth to breathe it all in. And the battle began...  
As he drew a long breath into his lungs he felt a peace deep within. He heard every sound of the city as his senses heightened. He sucked harder, and harder. Then he heard gun shots in the distance, but he knew that couldn't be so. He heard birds trilling in the trees, but they soon became the screams of dying men.   
"No!" He thought. "No, no, no! Please!"  
The dove began to rattle in his hand; it rattled, and rattled, and rattled, and began to shake so violently that he could hardly keep it in his grip. He screamed as it exploded in his hand and showered him in bits of glass. Bit's of building and rubble began to cave in around him as he curled up. He heard bits of rock and debris bounce off his metal helmet, the only thing protecting him from the onslaught above.

The sound of an incoming shell could be heard whistling down to earth like a prayer from hell. "screeeeeeeeeech, BOOOOM!"   
"Oh fuck, please no! Please, no!" He could feel himself being buried under the rubble. He rolled out onto the street and it stopped... It was quiet again. The sun was almost below the horizon and the street was covered in a horrible crimson light, covering the sleeping homeless, all dead.   
"You did this. You killed them." The voice whispered into his ear.

"I didn't do this." He whispered back.

He picked himself up and dusted off the dirt and debris that wasn't there. As he walked down the street he sidestepped the sleeping, and eventually built up the courage to look up at the street that he lived on; a street of stink and filth.

Neon signs lit the street all the way down. Light form Dive Bars and Flophouses and Old Cinemas with letters missing in their neon signs. Late night dinner parlous and Pool Bars too, smoke pouring out of the door whenever a beat old bum stumbled in or out. And all of this was accompanied by a familiar stink of loneliness that had settled over it all. "That's what war smells like." He said to himself. He was away from the fighting now. He was home, and yet it still smelled like war. War was everywhere.

He walked down the street with a melancholy in his step. His shoulders hunched, his old rubber shoes scraping along the dirty sidewalk littered with cigarette buts and spilt booze. He heard children playing down some alleyway, and thought back to his own childhood... A bullet of pain shot through him. It was too painful to think back on his own innocence. Too painful to think about and too long past to bring back to life. He couldn't taste them anymore. He couldn't taste his childhood. All he could taste was ash and smoke. "Too long." He thought.   
His skin felt itchy. It felt like bugs were crawling under his skin. He picked at them the way he always did. If he picked at them long enough they would go away. "Fucking fleas." He thought begrudgingly. It was the same in the trenches. The fleas went with you everywhere and there was nothing you could do about it... But he knew how to get rid of them. "Just one more for today." He promised himself.   
He continued down the street and past the cinema, turning right down the very first alleyway. It was littered with trash and smelt like a sewer, but that's how he liked it. He walked down to the end and sat against a red bricked wall. The sun had disappeared now, and the street was a soft blue-grey.   
He started unpacking his pockets with care, laying all his possessions out carefully. He counted his cards and cleaned his spoon and polished his gun, and tucked them all away leaving only his pipe and the white rocks.

"This will take care of those fucking fleas." He whispered to himself as he loaded a few of the white rocks into the end of the slender glass pipe, freshly cleaned and shiny. He found his lighter and lit it, and for a brief moment he saw his reflection in the round glass pipe. He saw his scraggily brown hair and his blue eyes and his sad sunken face. He looked half a ghost. He chuckled to himself as he brought the lighter to the glass.

As he sucked the air into his lungs a feeling of peace and clarity overwhelmed him. He heard the children playing in the distance, their childish screams getting closer, and closer. They were yelling and screaming. Yelling and screaming. Yelling and screaming. Two children appeared in the mouth of the alley holding toy wooden guns.

"Pow, pow pow pow." They shouted, as they made pretend at shooting one another. A car backfired in the distance with a, "BOOOOM."   
"Oh fuck. Please no." He whispered. The glass dove in his hand exploded and he screamed.   
Flashes of orange and red erupted from the end of the rifles as two soldiers came charging down the alley. Carlos pulled the pistol from his inner pocket and fired back. Bullets came whizzing past his head as he took cover behind a metal trash can. He unloaded his clip as quick as he could in short sharp bursts to keep his accuracy. "BANG BANG BANG... BANG BANG... BANG BANG BANG." Over and over until he saw the two soldiers drop to the ground.

The sun was well below the horizon when Carlos awoke to the sound of sirens. The night was black, lit up with red and blue light flashing in the street beyond. Police cars had pulled up and he could see the officers with drawn guns behind them. He looked out from behind the trash he was hiding behind and saw the two boys at the end of the alley. A pool of blood under them was running down toward him. Long red fingers of it illuminated by the flashing lights.

"You did this." A voice whispered in his ear. "You killed them."
