  The ground swirls and plummets upward out of nowhere. Concrete smacks you in
  the face. You stand up breathless and the night sways and twists. You are
  stuck in the swirling current of a shadowy asphalt ocean. Feet stumble
  underneath to keep your bobbling head upright. No words exist, and all your
  attention is focused on staying standing, to keep you from drowning. Neon
  lights from the signs of night clubs ooze red colours into the melted vision
  as you stagger across the road. You have no control over this, you are now a
  distant dreaming passenger that floats into the uncontrollable scene, then
  recedes back to the darker places of the mind, leaving all that staggering
  mess for some other creature to deal with.

The ground swirls and plummets upward out of nowhere. Concrete smacks you in the face. You stand up breathless and the night sways and twists. You are stuck in the swirling current of a shadowy asphalt ocean. Feet stumble underneath to keep your bobbling head upright. No words exist, and all your attention is focused on staying standing, to keep you from drowning. Neon lights from the signs of night clubs ooze red colours into the melted vision as you stagger across the road. You have no control over this, you are now a distant dreaming passenger that floats into the uncontrollable scene, then recedes back to the darker places of the mind, leaving all that staggering mess for some other creature to deal with.

You look down to the hairs on your arms and begin to brush off the wet dirt clinging to them. You turn your forearm over to show the underside of your wrist, and you see that there are three stamps smeared and smudged and unreadable; and no memories come from looking at them.

You are hugging a pole when you look up to a late night pizza joint on the street corner, spreading revealing white light out onto the street, covering a mob of kids lined up to order. Some are standing and eating in groups with a look of exhausted elated pleasure on their faces; laughing with friends as if those very slices were the greasy highlight of the night--- what they all made the effort to come out for... You're rueful, because you want a slice so desperately, but the pole has become your life raft and you can only breathe while you're clutching it.

You stare at an indian man wearing joggers and plain jeans that are ill fitting. Straight legged denim with no style to them. The man has dark swarthy skin and curly brown hair. His eyes are brown and wide and his breath slow and deliberate. He is all by himself and waiting patiently at the back of the short line. Your head lolls dead to one side, and your eyes try to keep the man in your field of vision, though, they are constantly losing and finding him in the swaying ocean. Soon it becomes something of a game, even an obsession really, that you keep up for fun or who knows why. You follow him to the front where he orders his slice, pays for it, and walks to a bench amidst the hoard of dolled up girls in high heels and boys in button ups, all heading toward the beach for the cooling touch of the salty sea breeze. He sits on the bench to eat his pizza, straight legged jeans and plain green T-shirt that is a little too short. "Whats his deal?" You think to yourself. He sits and stares at nothing in-particular. Guileless eyes that seem to wander around aimlessly, soaking in the bustling of the street. Your eyes, though, are fixed only upon him. Which seems to bring the extent of your swaying reality to its fullest.

You are walking arm in arm with a petite girl that is a fair bit shorter than you are. She is wearing a short black dress and is carrying her high-heel shoes in her free hand. She has a plain face and pale skin and her dark eyes are outlined with thick black mascara. Raggedy black hair falls to her shoulders in a bob; starting to curl and frizz from the humidity of the packed night clubs. She is talking, and you awake once more halfway through a sentence.

"I completely understand though," she says, "it's been two years now and I'm still not over my Ex."

Your arms are linked when all of your weight bears down on her. You collapse to the ground and fall to a half sitting position, your left arm is pulled high above your head as you cling desperately onto the girl... Desperately, with all the strength left in you. You can't let go. If you let go you won't be able to breathe. You'll drown in the asphalt. You'll die.

"Just leave her Jenna!" A male voice whines.

"NO! Fuck you guys." She snaps.

You're sitting on a bench and the girl is talking to you again, but you hear a second impatient command.

"Come on, we are going! Just leave her there, she'll be fine!"

"You guys don't understand us!" She yells back at him defensively. "I'm coming, just give us a sec."

She grabs your face and draws it close to hers with an intensity that you have never known before in life: from a lover, a parent or friend. You focus on her big black eyes brimming with tears. The street sways about her head but her eyes are stolid and unmoving and soulful and too powerful to look away.

"No one understands why we drink so much." Her hands still clasped over your cheeks, forcing you down into her deep black soul. "I was raped when I was fourteen" She says. "No one knows why we drink so much. No one. They don't understand."

You're lying on your back on the same bench, alone, when a large pair of guileless brown eyes bear down on you from above. In a second you are pushed up into a sitting position. White light laves over you from the pizza store. You stare at a pole further down the street erected up out of a shadow painted in a dull red glow from a strip club. A gentle hand pinches your jaw open and in a second your mouth is filled with a warm greasy flavour. You chew as your eyes fixate on the pole (the only completely stationary thing in the blurry swaying darkness beyond). You chew and chew and chew. And the melty flavours weep deliciously into your being. It is so warming and filling that it makes your eyes water with pleasure.

"Oh, this is why I came out."
