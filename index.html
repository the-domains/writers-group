</picture><p>“What are we?” He asked.</p><p>“Knock Knock”</p><p>“Oh come now, enough of that.”</p><p>“Knock Knock Knock.”</p><p>“You never give me a straightened out answer.”</p><p>“Straighten the calm water with your hand.”</p><p>“You see! You did it again. What are we?”</p><p>“Knock on the sky and listen.”</p><p>“You’re hopeless…”</p><p>“Planting flowers to which the butterflies come.”</p><p>A wind rustled through his fingers…“I thought I left my fingers by the stream.” He said, feeling them again for the first time.</p><p>“We are eternal.”</p><p>“Oh, yes! Now we are getting somewhere. What do you mean by that?”</p><p>“Move the mountain with your mind and see.”</p><p>A silence grew between them, a wind rustled. Birds chirped and the sound of water flowing down stream was everlasting.</p><p>“How long is this going to take?”</p><p>“Long and short both.”</p><p>“You know that doesn’t make any sense. If we are going to be here a long while, we mind as well be honest with each other. Just tell me. What are we?”</p><p>“What makes you think I know something that you don’t?”</p><p>He was surprised by the length of the answer. He never answered like that. Usually it was with riddles or strange noises, or sometimes even silence. He paused, thinking carefully about his next words. He wanted to keep the conversation going, but knew
    the very second he said the wrong thing, it would go back to riddles and noises. Or even silence, which was worst of all.</p><p>He thought, and thought, until the sun set somewhere behind, and darkness slowly rounded on them both, shrinking their worlds until everything disappeared into blackness. The sound of running water creeped on and on, accompanied by a cacophony of chittering
    birds and insects.</p><p>The words came to him as the sun began rise the next day, lifting itself over the mountains, illuminating the earth around them, growing, until the whole forest was painted in a pale grey light. He weighed each word carefully before he spoke it.</p><p>“Well,” He started gingerly, “because, you’re a bit higher up than I am. You can see a bit more than I can from up there.” He answered.</p><p>“I see nothing but forest and stream. The valley and the mountains beyond.”</p><p>He looked out at the mountains, and the stream that flowed between the two of them. “But that’s all that I see too.” He complained.</p><p>“What makes you think it’s the same?”</p><p>He thought carefully. It felt like he was finally getting somewhere, and the last thing he wanted was for it to go back to the way it was before. That was torture.</p><p>The sun instinctually set behind the mountains, leaving in its place a moonless night. Darkness swallowed them both and they were accompanied by nothing but the sound of running water, and an animal scurrying every now and then was like an itch being
    scratched. At last, he thought he found the words to say.</p><p>“Because we look the same.” He spoke out into the darkness. “Why shouldn’t we see the same too?”</p><p>“But you can’t see me. How do you even know what I look like?”</p><p>“That’s only because it’s dark! Wait until the light comes up and I will show you.”</p><p>He waited and watched. Until the sun came up and covered the forest in pearl grey light. He watched the outline of his companion come into focus, a little higher up on the other side of the stream, but still he waited. He waited until the sun rose to
    its highest, when the colours of the forest flourished their most vibrant shades of greens and browns and golds, and the water was at its clearest, sparkling as it flowed down between grey boulders.</p><p>“Can you see now? Surely you can. See how similar we look?” They both had the same sandy brown hair and blue eyes. The same dark oaken coloured skin and the same lanky limbs. Both of their arms were outstretched, and their long extended fingers twitched
    in the slightest breeze.</p><p>“So?”</p><p>“So, we are the same! And you must know who we are. You must!”</p><p>“I don’t want to tell you. I don’t think it’s a good idea.”</p><p>“What! Why not?”</p><p>“Because. I think you might take it badly.”</p><p>“No, I won’t. I promise.”</p><p>It was all he wanted. All he ever wanted from the very beginning. To know what he was. To know why he was here. To know what was coming at the end of it all. He figured there must be something else coming.</p><p>“Okay. Well, if I tell you, do you promise never to ask me ever again?”</p><p>“I promise, I promise! Just tell me who I am and I won’t ever need to ask.” He pleaded.</p><p>“Fine then, I’ll tell you, and then you never ask me again. And no other questions either. If I tell, you are never allowed to ask me a question ever again. And if you do, I won’t answer… So, are you sure you really want to know?”</p><p>“Yes, of course I do. Why wouldn’t I?”</p><p>“Well, it’s just that I think you like asking the questions. You have been asking them for a long time now.”</p><p>“And you have never answered before.”</p><p>“No, never.”</p><p>“Why?”</p><p>“I thought we were playing a game. But, I think I’ve realised now, you really just don’t know…”</p><p>“It’s true! I don’t know! All this time I was asking, and you would never tell me. It’s been torture. But I am ready to know, I promise I am.”</p><p>“Okay, I’ll tell you, and then no more questions. Ever. And things will go back to the way they were before.”</p><p>“Deal. Now just tell me.”</p><p>The sun set and darkness swallowed them up. Animals scurried in the forest, birds chirped, insects nagged incessantly. The river flowed humbly downstream between them. The sun rose and the forest came to life with colour and beauty, and he watched it
    all unfold as it did every day. He watched on as the sun rolled over the forest to set somewhere behind, until the sky turned orange. The darkness crept up slowly and one-thousand twinkling lights replaced the power of the sun, sparkling over them
    in majestic radiance. And as the sun began to rise again on the third day, a rain started in the valley below, and a rainbow formed over it. Only then did his companion uphold his promise.</p><p>“We are the mountains, the streams, the clouds. All of it. Both you and I. We are everything. And without us there would be nothing.”</p><p>“We are the mountains? How can we be the mountains… And the streams? I look nothing like a stream… What am I?</p><p>“Planting flowers to which the butterflies come.”</p><p>“What are we? Truly. Come now, you promised.”</p><p>“Knock Knock.”</p><p>“What am I? I’m not a mountain. I’m not! I can’t be.”</p><p>“Knock on the sky and listen.”</p><p>“Stop it! You tell me. You promised you would. You promised you would tell me. You promised to make it all stop. You promised to fix me!”</p><p>“Move the mountains with your mind.”</p><p>“Shut up! Shut up! Shut up!” He screamed. With a mighty heave he uprooted his feet from the rocky stream. He tore his arms from their outstretched position, dislocating them to his side. He turned his back on the mountains and valleys beyond, and started
    to make his way up the stream.</p><p>“You are walking the wrong way.” His companion observed.</p><p>With an effort he stopped. Turned around, staring into the almond brown eyes of his companion that matched his own. A feeling of hatred and resentment flared up inside of him. In a flash of rage, and with a strength and speed he never possessed before,
    he picked up a jagged stone by the stream and slammed it into his companions head. Red blood sprayed from his temple. Splattering the grey rocks and trees in scarlet stars. His companion stood fast, scarcely moving, with his arms outstretched and
    his fingers twitching. Blood ran down his neck and chest, down his belly and knees into the stream, mixing with the clear water.</p><p>“Yes. You are moving the mountains with your mind.” His companion whispered, and he collapsed into the stream.</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="44"><!-- react-empty: 45 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-a2ba8ba6-673a-43ce-b027-20c4db479026" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-white colors-global " data-reactid="46"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="47"><picture>

</picture><p>The wind bit at his sleeping face and his eyes twitched against the cold. In the distance on a busy street a bus slammed on its brakes with a “screeeeeeeeeech,” bringing it to a terrible halt, and an old car backfired with a “BOOOM,” as it accelerated
    up a hill.</p><p>He awoke, eyes darting open to observe the red glow left by the sun setting over the water in the distance. A light that seemed to paint everything dead: the parked cars, the street signs and street lights, the buildings and windows and the black fenced
    motel across the road… And the homeless, strewn all along the sidewalk like corpses, covered from head to toe under grey musky blankets. <br> Carlos observed the scene from the safety of his home, sheltered under the door frame of an old red-bricked
    factory. He looked out at the carnage of the street in dismay. <br> “You let them die. You did this.” A voice whispered in his ear… He ignored it. <br> He was wearing a large brown trench coat with pockets stitched on the inside with dark green thread.
    He reached into them one by one, emptying them, starting with his innermost pockets and working outward. He lay them all out on the street before him: a black and white photograph, a deck of cards, a silver spoon, a Colt M19 Pistol, a slender glass
    pipe, a lighter, and a little bag of small white rocks.<br> He took a pen and paper from his pants pocket and checked off each item, noting the condition and inspecting for defects.<br> He picked up the pistol and polished it methodically. He loaded
    and un-loaded the clip before putting it back in it’s rightful place deep within the countless folds. He counted all 52 of the playing cards and cleaned the spoon until it shone bright like knights armour. <br> With a shaky hand he cleaned his slender
    pipe with affection, cradling it like a wounded dove. Carefully, he picked up the small bag of white rocks and fed them into the mouth with a forbearance; with a guilty sin and pleasure. He lit the fire in one hand and brought it to his mouth to breathe
    it all in. And the battle began…<br> As he drew a long breath into his lungs he felt a peace deep within. He heard every sound of the city as his senses heightened. He sucked harder, and harder. Then he heard gun shots in the distance, but he knew
    that couldn’t be so. He heard birds trilling in the trees, but they soon became the screams of dying men. <br> “No!” He thought. “No, no, no! Please!”<br> The dove began to rattle in his hand; it rattled, and rattled, and rattled, and began to shake
    so violently that he could hardly keep it in his grip. He screamed as it exploded in his hand and showered him in bits of glass. Bit’s of building and rubble began to cave in around him as he curled up. He heard bits of rock and debris bounce off
    his metal helmet, the only thing protecting him from the onslaught above.</p><p>The sound of an incoming shell could be heard whistling down to earth like a prayer from hell. “screeeeeeeeeech, BOOOOM!” <br> “Oh fuck, please no! Please, no!” He could feel himself being buried under the rubble. He rolled out onto the street and it
    stopped… It was quiet again. The sun was almost below the horizon and the street was covered in a horrible crimson light, covering the sleeping homeless, all dead. <br> “You did this. You killed them.” The voice whispered into his ear.</p><p>“I didn’t do this.” He whispered back.</p><p>He picked himself up and dusted off the dirt and debris that wasn’t there. As he walked down the street he sidestepped the sleeping, and eventually built up the courage to look up at the street that he lived on; a street of stink and filth.</p><p>Neon signs lit the street all the way down. Light form Dive Bars and Flophouses and Old Cinemas with letters missing in their neon signs. Late night dinner parlous and Pool Bars too, smoke pouring out of the door whenever a beat old bum stumbled in or
    out. And all of this was accompanied by a familiar stink of loneliness that had settled over it all. “That’s what war smells like.” He said to himself. He was away from the fighting now. He was home, and yet it still smelled like war. War was everywhere.</p><p>He walked down the street with a melancholy in his step. His shoulders hunched, his old rubber shoes scraping along the dirty sidewalk littered with cigarette buts and spilt booze. He heard children playing down some alleyway, and thought back to his
    own childhood… A bullet of pain shot through him. It was too painful to think back on his own innocence. Too painful to think about and too long past to bring back to life. He couldn’t taste them anymore. He couldn’t taste his childhood. All he could
    taste was ash and smoke. “Too long.” He thought. <br> His skin felt itchy. It felt like bugs were crawling under his skin. He picked at them the way he always did. If he picked at them long enough they would go away. “Fucking fleas.” He thought begrudgingly.
    It was the same in the trenches. The fleas went with you everywhere and there was nothing you could do about it… But he knew how to get rid of them. “Just one more for today.” He promised himself. <br> He continued down the street and past the cinema,
    turning right down the very first alleyway. It was littered with trash and smelt like a sewer, but that’s how he liked it. He walked down to the end and sat against a red bricked wall. The sun had disappeared now, and the street was a soft blue-grey.
    <br> He started unpacking his pockets with care, laying all his possessions out carefully. He counted his cards and cleaned his spoon and polished his gun, and tucked them all away leaving only his pipe and the white rocks.</p><p>“This will take care of those fucking fleas.” He whispered to himself as he loaded a few of the white rocks into the end of the slender glass pipe, freshly cleaned and shiny. He found his lighter and lit it, and for a brief moment he saw his reflection
    in the round glass pipe. He saw his scraggily brown hair and his blue eyes and his sad sunken face. He looked half a ghost. He chuckled to himself as he brought the lighter to the glass.</p><p>As he sucked the air into his lungs a feeling of peace and clarity overwhelmed him. He heard the children playing in the distance, their childish screams getting closer, and closer. They were yelling and screaming. Yelling and screaming. Yelling and screaming.
    Two children appeared in the mouth of the alley holding toy wooden guns.</p><p>“Pow, pow pow pow.” They shouted, as they made pretend at shooting one another. A car backfired in the distance with a, “BOOOOM.” <br> “Oh fuck. Please no.” He whispered. The glass dove in his hand exploded and he screamed. <br> Flashes of orange and
    red erupted from the end of the rifles as two soldiers came charging down the alley. Carlos pulled the pistol from his inner pocket and fired back. Bullets came whizzing past his head as he took cover behind a metal trash can. He unloaded his clip
    as quick as he could in short sharp bursts to keep his accuracy. “BANG BANG BANG… BANG BANG… BANG BANG BANG.” Over and over until he saw the two soldiers drop to the ground.</p><p>The sun was well below the horizon when Carlos awoke to the sound of sirens. The night was black, lit up with red and blue light flashing in the street beyond. Police cars had pulled up and he could see the officers with drawn guns behind them. He looked
    out from behind the trash he was hiding behind and saw the two boys at the end of the alley. A pool of blood under them was running down toward him. Long red fingers of it illuminated by the flashing lights.</p><p>“You did this.” A voice whispered in his ear. “You killed them.”</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="48"><!-- react-empty: 49 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-c9310c98-875f-47fd-ac1f-a41d4980803d" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="50"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="51"><picture>

</picture><p>The ground swirls and plummets upward out of nowhere. Concrete smacks you in the face. You stand up breathless and the night sways and twists. You are stuck in the swirling current of a shadowy asphalt ocean. Feet stumble underneath to keep your bobbling
    head upright. No words exist, and all your attention is focused on staying standing, to keep you from drowning. Neon lights from the signs of night clubs ooze red colours into the melted vision as you stagger across the road. You have no control over
    this, you are now a distant dreaming passenger that floats into the uncontrollable scene, then recedes back to the darker places of the mind, leaving all that staggering mess for some other creature to deal with.</p><p>You look down to the hairs on your arms and begin to brush off the wet dirt clinging to them. You turn your forearm over to show the underside of your wrist, and you see that there are three stamps smeared and smudged and unreadable; and no memories come
    from looking at them.</p><p>You are hugging a pole when you look up to a late night pizza joint on the street corner, spreading revealing white light out onto the street, covering a mob of kids lined up to order. Some are standing and eating in groups with a look of exhausted elated
    pleasure on their faces; laughing with friends as if those very slices were the greasy highlight of the night— what they all made the effort to come out for… You’re rueful, because you want a slice so desperately, but the pole has become your life
    raft and you can only breathe while you’re clutching it.</p><p>You stare at an indian man wearing joggers and plain jeans that are ill fitting. Straight legged denim with no style to them. The man has dark swarthy skin and curly brown hair. His eyes are brown and wide and his breath slow and deliberate. He is all
    by himself and waiting patiently at the back of the short line. Your head lolls dead to one side, and your eyes try to keep the man in your field of vision, though, they are constantly losing and finding him in the swaying ocean. Soon it becomes something
    of a game, even an obsession really, that you keep up for fun or who knows why. You follow him to the front where he orders his slice, pays for it, and walks to a bench amidst the hoard of dolled up girls in high heels and boys in button ups, all
    heading toward the beach for the cooling touch of the salty sea breeze. He sits on the bench to eat his pizza, straight legged jeans and plain green T-shirt that is a little too short. “Whats his deal?” You think to yourself. He sits and stares at
    nothing in-particular. Guileless eyes that seem to wander around aimlessly, soaking in the bustling of the street. Your eyes, though, are fixed only upon him. Which seems to bring the extent of your swaying reality to its fullest.</p><p>You are walking arm in arm with a petite girl that is a fair bit shorter than you are. She is wearing a short black dress and is carrying her high-heel shoes in her free hand. She has a plain face and pale skin and her dark eyes are outlined with thick
    black mascara. Raggedy black hair falls to her shoulders in a bob; starting to curl and frizz from the humidity of the packed night clubs. She is talking, and you awake once more halfway through a sentence.</p><p>“I completely understand though,” she says, “it’s been two years now and I’m still not over my Ex.”</p><p>Your arms are linked when all of your weight bears down on her. You collapse to the ground and fall to a half sitting position, your left arm is pulled high above your head as you cling desperately onto the girl… Desperately, with all the strength left
    in you. You can’t let go. If you let go you won’t be able to breathe. You’ll drown in the asphalt. You’ll die.</p><p>“Just leave her Jenna!” A male voice whines.</p><p>“NO! Fuck you guys.” She snaps.</p><p>You’re sitting on a bench and the girl is talking to you again, but you hear a second impatient command.</p><p>“Come on, we are going! Just leave her there, she’ll be fine!”</p><p>“You guys don’t understand us!” She yells back at him defensively. “I’m coming, just give us a sec.”</p><p>She grabs your face and draws it close to hers with an intensity that you have never known before in life: from a lover, a parent or friend. You focus on her big black eyes brimming with tears. The street sways about her head but her eyes are stolid and
    unmoving and soulful and too powerful to look away.</p><p>“No one understands why we drink so much.” Her hands still clasped over your cheeks, forcing you down into her deep black soul. “I was raped when I was fourteen” She says. “No one knows why we drink so much. No one. They don’t understand.”</p><p>You’re lying on your back on the same bench, alone, when a large pair of guileless brown eyes bear down on you from above. In a second you are pushed up into a sitting position. White light laves over you from the pizza store. You stare at a pole further
    down the street erected up out of a shadow painted in a dull red glow from a strip club. A gentle hand pinches your jaw open and in a second your mouth is filled with a warm greasy flavour. You chew as your eyes fixate on the pole (the only completely
    stationary thing in the blurry swaying darkness beyond). You chew and chew and chew. And the melty flavours weep deliciously into your being. It is so warming and filling that it makes your eyes water with pleasure.</p><p>”Oh, this is why I came out.”</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="52"><!-- react-empty: 53 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-61241c14-2fb3-4bc2-8f7e-a849b037810d" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-light colors-global " data-reactid="54"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="55"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/b424bd06-f45e-476d-8a65-038620546515.jpg" title="The Drover" alt="By James Frankland"><p>Oh, my darling… What have I done…<br> Will you promise that you love me, still? No matter the things I’ve seen and done. I am afraid that I am all too ready to come home, my love… I want to come back now. I’ve seen enough. I want to come back to the station.
    Oh, GOD do I want that more than anything in this world! I want my eyes to wander over the land. I want my eyes to scan over the plains for miles in every direction, over the vast freedom of it all. I want my eyes to look over your body too, once
    more, my dearest. Damn, just to look at you would be enough. Just one look would keep me going. Here, we have nothing but the view of these god-forsaken cliffs and trenches (at the present moment, if I put my head up for a peek of anything, I’d likely
    be given a pill in my forehead)… Yes, a pill. A sweet Turkish kiss…</p><p>I want to herd my cattle again, that was what I was born to do, not this. I want a fucking horse beneath my legs again!… You must excuse me, dear, I am not myself. Nor have I been for some time, I suppose. The rats are eating Jamie’s eyes now. We couldn’t
    get to him out in no man’s land… Oh, what am I saying? You don’t need to hear about all that. All you need to know is I am alive and doing well, my darling, and thinking of your sweet kiss. Yes, a sweet kiss…</p><p>I am almost there with you now, if I think hardly on it. With this hot sun beating down on my skin, if I just close my eyes and feel the heat— the dirt in my fingernails and the taste of dust in my mouth— the crack of a rifle could almost be the sound
    of a whip in my hand, and the moaning of these wounded men could be those beautiful dumb beasts; my cattle.</p><p>I think I should tell you that, before he went over, I had some words with Jamie.</p><p>“Is that you, Jamie?” Walking the line I spotted him busy carving his name into the trench wall with his bayonet.“Whats this you’re up too?” I asked, (most others were busy polishing and cleaning rifle for the assault, fixing bayonets to the end, but
    here he was carving with his). “I dare say, chap, that there bayonet would be a dash more useful attached at the end of rifle.”</p><p>“G’day Lieutenant,” he responded all chipper, “oh this? It ain’t nothing. Just wanted to leave a little reminder here, is all.”</p><p>“A reminder of what?” I questioned.</p><p>“Why, a reminder of me, Lieutenant.”</p><p>This did strike a cord with me. Poor bugger was secretly terrified, although, his face refused to show it. He was a deep thinker, you see, and this was his first of any real fighting.“You will be just fine Jamie, we will take Johnny Turk completely by
    surprise, and have the trench in no time.” I reassured him. But this didn’t seem to ease his nerves the slightest. He ignored me, and for the longest time was set to scratching the date of his birth into the wall.1898! He was only seventeen god save
    him. He scratched a small dash and then the days date in as well. I sat down and settled myself beside him. I took out a pack of coffin nails and offered him one, (he tried to refuse, but I held it firm until he took it). I lit mine and took a deep
    pull, I lit his next and he did the same — damn near coughed his lungs out! For fuck sake it was his first… Too young, far too young darling. He asked me a question that might haunt me until my last.</p><p>“Whats it like to die, Lieutenant? You’ve seen em die, haven't ya?” He asked, his cigarette pitched awkwardly at his side. I took a long draw and observed his face, young and clean shaven for the occasion— a rare thing on the front, (water being desperately
    rationed), blonde with curly hair and baby blue eyes. I exhaled and saw that his lip was quivering.</p><p>“I am going to die, Lieutenant. I don’t want to go over the top. I am going to die and I know it. Don't you give me that bullshit encouragement neither! I know my times up, I can feel it… Please don’t make me do it Lieutenant…” He pleaded. “Please, I’m
    too young, don’t make me go over.”</p><p>I didn’t say anything. I couldn’t. What do you tell a boy? If he didn’t go over he’d be shot for treason, he didn’t have a choice.</p><p>“You signed up for this kid, what did you think it would be like?” I said. I watched him take a small pull, holding it down this time and breathing out a wispy puff of smoke. “Not like this” He said without a voice, no emotion in him. “I don’t much care
    to die, gonna happen anyways I suppose. I just want to know a little what it will be like. I’m scared not knowing is all.”</p><p>I didn’t have any words for him. But he reminded me of a friend I had a while back, when we were stationed in Egypt. A true thinker he was, called himself a philosopher, but was godless and a drinker too. Well, one night he got drunk, and started talking
    about death and all the rest. But it seemed to make real sense and gave me some real comfort as a younger lad. So I gave him his words instead.</p><p>“Have you ever had a good sleep, Jamie? No, not the ones here, where you wake up every thirty minutes from shelling, one of those deep, dreamless peaceful sleeps. Where you wake up and have to remember who you are.” We both stopped and took another draw,
    getting all lost in old memories which took us a miles away from the turkish cliffs.</p><p>He said, “Yeah, I know that kind, had one of em back home before I shipped out. I’ll tell it true, Lieutenant, It was right after I gave my sheila her first root! Ha!” He laughed so hard, I tell you darling, that it made me laugh! But made me sad and
    happy all at once, because he had me truly convinced that he wasn't going to make it, and it was like we were having his bloody funeral, right there and then! And his fucking gravestone over his head with the dates and all! Like I was talking to the
    ghost of him. He was a handsome chap, I must say. And looked more so when he laughed, and when he smiled it looked as if he harnessed all the happiness of the world. Eventually we both simmered down, and he apologised. “Sorry Lieutenant. You were
    saying, about that deep sleepin’?” We took another drag each, longer and fuller still. And it became all serious again, darling. And we stared into each others eyes, (his were the bluest I’ve ever seen).</p><p>“Imagine that you go into one of those deep, dreamless sleeps, Jamie. And now imagine that you failed to wake up.” He thought about it. “That is how I imagine death to be. And if you’re a god fearing man, well then, you’ll be going to heaven, won’t you?
    And that wouldn’t be so bad now, would it?” I smiled at him and he chuckled, but tears rolled down his cheeks. He leaned back against the trench wall and closed his eyes. And kept them closed while he took another drag; his longest yet. And above
    his head his name and those dates. And I saw, in that moment, darling, that the dash between the two numbers… that dash held all his life. And one day, I would have one of similar length on my tomb stone, and it would hold all of my living as well.
    I couldn’t bear it anymore, so I patted him gently on the shoulder, and he didn’t rouse one bit, but took another breath of smoke into his lungs and smiled, almost imperceptibly. And with that I continued down the line to check on the other men, but
    the whole time I could think only of Jamie… Jamie.</p><p>I failed to mention that I was promoted to second Lieutenant and platoon leader, (it has been some time since I last wrote), and with that I was given a stout whistle with a plaited leather lanyard. After I did the rounds and readied the men, I took my
    pocket watch in hand, watched it ticking intently. It was two minutes to the schedule. And for that entire two minutes I thought of Jamie. I realised that I didn’t want him to go over. I wanted to save him. If I blew the whistle he was dead. I already
    knew that men would die, but it was different now. I could still save him, I thought. If he was sick and deemed not fit for duty, I could give him leave. But he was too far down the line, you see. I’d never make it to him in time. And the watch kept
    ticking, ticking, ticking.</p><p>It was deathly silent, my love. A silence I never knew before. A silence so thick that I was sure it could have stopped the bullets in the air. When there was ten seconds left I put the brass and copper whistle to my mouth, and realised that my hand was
    shaking violently. And then I blew. A terrible high screech that cut the silence open to the shouting cheers of men. It wasn’t long until I heard the typewriters start up. Rattling horribly like caged death being released. I blew it again after that,
    and again. Until the thirty-three men of my platoon were up and over the top, climbing over the dead and dying. I herded them, darling, like they were cattle. Herded them up and over and into the fields of death.</p><p>Oh, If these cliffs could tell stories, they would be sad ones, my dearest. They would be the whispers of final prayers and unsaid fair-wells. And if they could talk… oh, they would be the bane of the widows I tell you! For how could the heartbroken live?
    Knowing that somewhere out in the world, there’s a blood-stained foreign soil, holding greedily onto desperate words spoken in one final moment of love. Surely, they couldn’t live knowing… Surely, you would come, wouldn’t you darling? Will you come?
    Come here and kiss the dirt to hear my voice one last time?</p></div><div class="fl-l t-0 ms-p-2 w-20" data-reactid="56"><!-- react-empty: 57 --></div></section><section id="section-Fallback-3fee2c39-ca6c-45a4-8488-adadf37db838" class="Section Section--components-1 Fallback title-size-large color-box-pop p-h-0 fade-in  color-bg text-align-center  colors-black colors-global " data-reactid="58"><div class="Component p-2 ms-m-l-20p ms-m-r-0 ms-w-60p max-w-0 " data-reactid="59"><img src="https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/7b280a5e-87d8-4a19-a86f-6e706898e4f0.jpg" title="If The Bar Had Eyes" alt="By Zachariah Frankland"><p>“But I don’t get it, how could you say he deserves it?” He asked, taking a nip of his own drink; a dry whisky on the rocks.</p><p>“Well, you take a long look at him and tell me whose else fault it is.” At the mahogany bar a man sat in a disheveled, pale blue suit: tall, overweight, blonde hair thinning at the top. His white shirt underneath was untucked at the back like a ducks
    tail, protruding out from his suit jacket. “He’s only half way to homelessness at the moment, but he’ll end up there— mark my words.”</p><p>“You come in here often, then?”</p><p>“Yeah, most nights. I’ve watched you plenty of times, but there isn’t much to see. You just come in, order the same brand of whisky and shell up. Well, beg my pardon— it should be said— you don’t shell up the way most drinkers do. Your eyes don’t look
    backward, they just sort of… Forgive me for prying but if I had to guess I’d say your a man that’s seen too much, rather than not too little.”</p><p>He gave a snort of laughter. “That’s not far off the mark. I retired last month, if you want to call it that.”</p><p>“That makes sense. You still dress like one of them— trench coat and all. I’d have guessed, but I always prefer to hear it for myself.”</p><p>The conversation died on their lips. The man at the bar polished off his glass and ordered another one. The bartender turned to get him one. “Maybe something happened to him. Maybe business went bad.” He said, taking another a nip of his whisky. “Or a
    business partner swindled him. I’ve seen that story played out plenty of times.”</p><p>“Whatever happened he deserved it. Same way he deserves to be a drunk.”</p><p>“I’d prefer to believe he got dealt a bad hand… How does anyone deserve to be a drunk?”</p><p>“Because, it’s what he really wants, deep down.”</p><p>“Yeah? Well why don’t you go over and ask him if it’s what he really wants…” He said, tilting his whisky glass in his hand, watching the amber coloured liquid collect in the corner.</p><p>“Oh, he would make some excuse up, no doubt. He puts on a real show when he gets going— he could blame a butterfly for his balding.”</p><p>“Maybe he would; but he still doesn’t deserve it. No one does.”</p><p>The bartender poured another drink for the drunk and slid it across the counter to him. He caught it gracefully in his hand without barely moving it left or right. It was like watching a worn out dance; both partners knowing the steps a little too well.
    “He ordered that drink because he wanted it, and because he wanted it— he got it. Because he got it— he deserves it. And if he passes out drunk on the way home and some punk steals his wallet he will deserve that just as much.”</p><p>Just then the door of the bar burst open, silencing them, as a girl in a tight fitting yellow dress strolled in. Wide hips, long legs and a curtain of brown curls fell to her shoulders. From their table in the corner, shrouded in shadow from a beam that
    crossed the ceiling light, they watched her take a seat in a empty booth. She pulled out her phone and started texting.</p><p>“Pretty thing.” He said, raising the whisky glass once more to his lips.</p><p>“Oh, boy. You are in for a <em>real </em>treat tonight.” A smile crept across his face, crooked and knowing.</p><p>“Oh yeah? And why’s that.”</p><p>“Snake eyes is in tonight. Might be we’re both going to get more than we bargained for.”</p><p>“Who’s snake eyes?”</p><p>“That guy over there in the corner with the baseball cap drinking gin. That’s his third tonight. She could be in some real hot water if he goes for a fourth. It’s hit or miss for the moment— on a knifes edge so to speak…”</p><p>“What are you talking about?”</p><p>“No point beating around the bush. Snake eyes is a rapist.”</p><p>“Bullshit.”</p><p>“I don’t know what he says to them— or even what he does to them— but they never seem to squawk. He’ll disappear for a month or two. Idk, maybe he goes someplace else. Maybe he just waits until the heat dies down. Either way he’s been back in the game
    a couple of weeks now.”</p><p>“Bullshit.” He took another quick sip, a little nervously, as he considered the man sitting at a table near the entrance. His instincts immediately kicked in. His cap was drawn low over his eyes. He wore a nondescript grey flannel and blue jeans. He had
    a good view of the bar and wouldn’t be seen immediately by anyone who came through the entrance. It all made sense. “What are the chances he’ll go through with it?” He asked.</p><p>“Well, that depends entirely on what the girls wants.”</p><p>He put his glass down on the table and turned slowly to look the man in the eyes. They were dark brown, like the darkened timber tables around them. They were like the bar itself, in fact. If the bar had eyes. “You can’t mean th—“</p><p>“You know what I mean.” He said, the crooked smile evaporating from his face. “Let’s see what little miss daisy <em>really </em>wants, deep down.”</p><p>The conversation died on their lips.</p><p>They watched her text on her phone for a while, then she put it down and started toying absently with a napkin. Eventually the waiter came around and she ordered herself a drink. Snake eyes ordered his fourth. She picked up her phone again, but had seemed
    to run out of patience for it’s company, scrolling back and forth idly. She glanced back at the door three times during all of this.</p><p>A little while later she finished her drink and made for the door. Her long legs working in graceful strides, causing her hips to bounce about. As she left Snake Eyes quickly raised his glass, making the pretence of a sip, covering his face from her view.
    His eyes followed her to the door and his head turned to watch her leave. As she did he lowered the glass a little and then froze, as if caught in some internal struggle. He sat there still as a stone statue for a moment, and then a moment more. Finally
    with a flourish he threw his head back and downed the last of his gin. He stood up made for the door after her.</p><p>“Well I’ll be damned.” He said, rising to his feet, bumping the table and knocking over his whisky glass. The man grabbed him by the sleeve of his trench coat.</p><p>“Hold on one second. Do you really want to get in the way this? This is fate, friend. This is what she really wants. What they both want.”</p><p>He paused, considering the mans grip on his sleeve. “Listen Mr… I don’t give a fuck what you say; she doesn’t deserve it I’m not going to sit around and let it that happen.”</p><p>“Well alright then, you go and stop him. But before you do I want you to know the way of it. The true way of it… A girl like that— dressed up in her gaudy Sunday ensemble— parks her car in the only space left across the street. Don’t believe me? Well,
    I guess you’ll find out soon enough… She goes waltzing down that dark alley to get here, but she ignores that nagging fear in her guts. “<em>Only girls are afraid of the dark</em>.” She tells herself. Now she comes bursting into a bar full of— well,
    to be completely honest— less than reputable middle aged men; mostly single, divorced, or just plain randy. She waits, but her friend stands her up— which is no big shocker— as this particular friend was known to be un-unreliable on occasion. “<em>That bimbo Brittany stood me up again! Oh well.</em>”
    She tells herself, ignoring that nagging fear that hasn’t quite gone away since she came in through that door. Well, she downs her one drink, gets eyeballed the whole time by old snake eyes, and she doesn’t spook. A horse would have spooked. A <em>dog</em>    would have spooked. She doesn’t. Not even a little. She just gets right on up and fish walks out of here snapping her little ass left to right— back down that fucked-up-dark alley she had a bad feeling in the first time… Now, looking at the whole
    of it, you tell me there wasn’t something else going on here tonight.”</p><p>He paused, for a moment, staring at the mans curious eyes, considering his words. He paused a moment longer.
